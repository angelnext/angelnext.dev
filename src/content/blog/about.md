Hey, Welcome to my blog, I am a programmer and Linux enthusiast, I love working on open-source software.

#### Some things about me

I love programming in general, but this are the technologies and tools I use and enjoy the most:

- Rust (long live Rust)
- TypeScript (Made JavaScript usable, something I didn't believe was possible)
- Astro (Best web frontend framework, change my mind)
- Svelte (Amazing web framework, although I mostly use it in Astro Components)
- Go (for web backend)
- Lua (amazing for scripting, I mainly use it for my [neovim configuration](https://github.com/angelnext/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim))
- Neovim (Amazing extensible editor)
- Linux (Do I have to say anything else?)
