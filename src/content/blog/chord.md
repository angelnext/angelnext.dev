Today I showcase yet another one of my projects, Chord, if you're thinking of making a Discord bot, this will interest you.

## What is Chord?

[@Chord](https://github.com/AngelNext/chord) is an open-source discord.js template for complex Discord bots.

It is very simple and easy to use, and it only comes with discord.js and zod as a dependency, although zod is fully optional

## Why use Chord?

- Built on top of discord.js
- Simple commands and events
- Build on TypeScript
- Open-source

## What if Chord isn't working as expected?
