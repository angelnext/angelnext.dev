Hi, my name is Ángel González Vázquez, I am a student and programmer hobbyist. I've been programming for 4 years, and I've gathered some experience in the proccess that I wanna show you, in the form of this blog. I don't have a posting schedule exactly, but I'll do my best to share new things I learn or things I've been learning.
